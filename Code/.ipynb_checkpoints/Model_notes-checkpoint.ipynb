Further, the highest $Ea$ has the highest bacteria mass which contradicts all previous work and runs of the vectorised model.\n",

This is when the $Ea$ are the same. When the $Ea$ are different (Scenario 3b), the one with the resource input wins and as of yet there is no relationship between the bacteria with 0 external input of resources and the analytical solution but could be related to the relative difference in $Ea$.\n",
