    "Motivation: To examine how microbial communities and ecosystem function will respond to warming and disturbance (e.g. chemical pollution such as pesticides or antibiotics). This model investigates the impact of response of bacteria to warming based on different functional groups competing for the same resources. This will add to the small body of literature which emphasises that: 'food web response to temperature cannot be derived from the single species temperature response' [(Nomdedeuet al. 2013)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00227-012-1966-x.pdf). In most food web/low trophic/biogeochemical models changes to species/functional group interactions with warming are not considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model builds on the work by [Marsland et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006793), which uses the seminal MacArthur (1970) species competition model. It includes a consumer pool (bacteria) and a resource pool (organic compounds). The bacteria can feed on specific resources only, and the resources consumed by the bacteria can be converted into other resources. Multiple bacteria with different functional traits (e.g. size, response to warmings (Thermal Performance Curves, TPCs), nutrient preference) compete for the same resourse. This notebook sets out the model and determines which traits are selected for under different environment and community scenarios.\n",

Further, the highest $Ea$ has the highest bacteria mass which contradicts all previous work and runs of the vectorised model.\n",

This is when the $Ea$ are the same. When the $Ea$ are different (Scenario 3b), the one with the resource input wins and as of yet there is no relationship between the bacteria with 0 external input of resources and the analytical solution but could be related to the relative difference in $Ea$.\n",

The second part of the equation is the Sharpe-Schoofield equation where $E$ is the activation energy in eV, $E_D$ is the deactivation energy after the temperature maximum metabolism is reached ($T_{pk}$), $T$ is the temperature and $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature.

    "It is uncertain whether size would increase fitness/population size in bacteria. This is because a larger size could increase genome increasing growth rate, but could also increase maintenance respiration ($Rm_i$) which would negatively impact on growth rates and population size. Instead of forcing size to have a positive or negative impact on population size both these relationships can be incorporated into the model. As body size increases, $u_{ij}$ will rise, increasing uptake and have a positive impact on population growth. $Rm_i$ will also increase with body size, but this is a loss term from the bacteria consumer so decreases overall population growth. $B$ for $u_{ij}$ (growth, $Bg$) will be higher than for $Rm_i$ (respiration, $Brm$)."
