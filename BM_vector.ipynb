    "This model builds on the work by [Marsland et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006793). It includes a consumer pool (bacteria) and a resource pool (organic compounds). The bacteria can feed on specific resources only, and the resources consumed by the bacteria can be converted into other resources. This notebook sets out the two ODEs of the model and the vectorised equations."
